"""Breakable ACL graph capture/replay.

This is an alternative to :class:`ACLGraphWrapper` that replaces vLLM's
torch.compile-based FX graph splitting with runtime stream-capture
breaks.

The idea (inspired by sgl-project/sglang#19102): instead of pre-splitting
the model into many pieces at attention boundaries, a
single capture context drives the whole forward and intercepts
attention / kv-cache custom ops at the dispatcher to end the current
stream capture, run the op eagerly, and resume capture.

The captured artifact is a list of zero-arg callables -- the bound
``ACLGraph.replay`` for graph segments, or the user fn for eager
segments -- replayed in order at inference time.

Eager segments must operate on the same static buffers used during
capture so subsequent graph segments read the same memory addresses.

    """Decorator that turns a custom-op Python kernel into a "break point"
    for the breakable aclgraph capture.

    When the decorated function is invoked outside of a
    :class:`BreakableACLGraphCapture` context, it executes normally.

    When invoked inside a capture context, it ends the current aclgraph
    segment, runs the function eagerly on the capture stream, records the
    callable for replay, and starts a fresh segment.

    **In-place output buffer required.** Decorated ops must write into a
    caller-provided output tensor; a fresh tensor returned by ``fn`` would
    change address each replay and break downstream graph segments.

    **Decorator order matters.** Apply as the *outermost* decorator if
    there are other decorators that introduce host-side side effects
    around the call -- the canonical example is
    ``@maybe_transfer_kv_layer`` for PD-disaggregation, whose
    ``wait_for_layer_load`` and ``save_kv_layer`` calls must run in the
    eager segment, not inside the captured aclgraph. Putting
    ``@eager_break_during_capture`` *inside* such a decorator would
    record those side effects into the graph and hang on replay.

    The correct order is::

        @eager_break_during_capture   # outermost
        @maybe_transfer_kv_layer
